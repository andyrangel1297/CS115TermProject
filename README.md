CS115 Project Part 1
====================

Program Description
--------------------

The program implements eight different sorting algorithms including Selection, Merge, Insertion, Bubble, Quick, Radix, Heap, and Counting sorts.  For each sorting algorithm, the program measures the time taken to sort an array of size 10, 100, 1000, and 10000 in the best, worst, and average case.

Getting Started
--------------------

To use this program, follow these steps:
    
    1. Clone the repository or download the source code files
    2. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the source code files.
    3. Compile the source code files using a C++ compiler.  
    
    For example, using g++: g++ -o experiment experiment.cpp Selection.cpp Merge.cpp Insertion.cpp Bubble.cpp Radix.cpp Heap.cpp Counting.cpp

    4. Run the program by typing './experiment' in the terminal.

Dependencies
--------------------

This program was implemented using C++ and requires a C++ compiler to comile and run the source code files.

Results
--------------------

The program prints the time taken for each sorting algorithm to sort an array of size 10, 100, 1000, and 100000 in the best, worst, and average case.  The results are printed to the console in microseconds.
